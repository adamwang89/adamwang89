### Hi there, I'm Adam ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**adamwang89/adamwang89** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am currently a second year computer science major at Carnegie Mellon University! I'm really passionate about designing end-to-end user applications to benefit my life and the lives of others around me. I am currently very interested in the topics of human-computer interaction, internet of things (IOT), computer vision and full stack development! 

This summer, I decided to advance my skills in full stack development which lead me to create various projects. My main projects that I decided to embark on was:

* League Of Logistics (Web link coming soon once approval is received from Riot Games)
  League of Legends is an online MOBA game that has millions of users. Every week, Riot Games (parent company) releases a variety of sales that may be hard to track for players who don't frequent the website. My brother and I decided to solve this problem by allowing users to view champion profiles, add them on to their wishlist, and get reminded whenever their favorite skins go on sale! We also are working a feature to try to predict when a skin / champ could potentially go on sale using data we collect on the last time they go on sale.
  
* CMU Connect
  Orientation can be a very daunting time for many students all across the world. It usually is the first time students say goodbye to their parents as they embark on a new journey. From personal experiences and accounts of others, meeting new friends can be scary at first. Connect will try to break down this barrier as one of the first campus wide social apps that displays active events created by other students for people to join. * Currently still in the works. Should be finished sometime late August or early September *
  

* CMU Seats
  ###Project currently being in the works. The main timeline for finishing will be during winter break (December 2020 - January 2021). Currently, my team and I are trying to tackle the perenial issue of seating assignments that occurs during the lunch rush hour at CMU. We are currently being mentored by CMU professors who has worked in IOT and computer vision.
  
 
The projects mentioned above are privated. If you are a recruiter who would like to see more details behind the code and design process that went into making these projects or a programmer who would be interested in adding onto the codebase, feel free to email me at adamwang@andrew.cmu.edu and I will share the repo with you!

On the meantime, feel free to look at the projects I have listed below which are meant to be learning experiences for me and you! The projects pinned below explores newer features of web development like redux, css grids, sass, etc as well as simple python bots to automate and make repetitive tasks easier! 

I am very friendly and would love to talk with anyone that wants to reach out to me! Feel free to connect with my on [Linkedin](linkedin.com/in/adam-w-8900631aa)
